https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb

Install usbipd and follow the tutorial on the website and run the usbipd command in WINDOWS ELEVATED command prompt or powershell

usbipd wsl list
usbipd wsl attach --busid <busid>

Then in your linux terminal, you need to chmod the usb device so the software can access it:

sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0

Note: you will need to repeat this command for each arduino connected.
